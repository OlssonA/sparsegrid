Smolyak Sparse Grid Interpolation
=================================

This library is an implementation of Smolyak’s Sparse Grid Algorithm for solving
integration and interpolation problems in d-dim spaces with far fewer function
evaluations than needed with traditional tensor production
integration / interpolation.

Implementation
--------------
This library is mostly a sandbox for testing sparse grid applications

I deeply vampirized Michael Tompkins implementation https://github.com/geofizx/Sparse-Grid-Interpolation
The major updates are based on code cleaning and interface. Note that I did not
optimize the code for speed (yet).

This library currently implements Smolyak's algorithm for two polynomial bases:

* Clenshaw-Curtis - Piecewise Linear Basis Functions
* Chebyshev Polynomials - Cos Basis Functions

All goes through the same interface class `SparseInterpolator`.

Example
-------

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np
    from sparsegrid import SparseInterpolator

    def func(x):
        """ Example function for 2d data """
        func2d = ((
            0.5 / np.pi * x[:, 0] -
            .51 / (.4 * np.pi ** 2) * x[:, 0] ** 2 +
            x[:, 1] - (.6)) ** 2 + (1 - 1 / (.8 * np.pi)) * np.cos(x[:, 0]) + .10)
        return func2d
    
    dim = 2                   # Dimensionality of function to interpolate
    level_max = 6             # Maximum degree of interpolation
    shape = Nx, Ny = 21, 21   # values on x and y

    Ntot = Nx * Ny
    x = np.linspace(0, 1, Nx)
    y = np.linspace(0, 1, Ny)
    X,  Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
    gridout = np.asarray([X.reshape(Ntot), Y.reshape(Ntot)]).T

    integration_interval = np.asarray([[0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0]]).T
    interpolation_type = 'CH'
    interp = SparseInterpolator(level_max, dim, 
                                interpolation_type, 
                                integration_interval)
    # fitting returns also the interpolated values
    output = interp.fit(func, gridout)
    # one can evaluate the interpolation at any other point futher on
    output = interp.evaluate(gridout)


Method
------

Sergey Smolyak introduced a numerical technique where the number of grid points
needed to approximate grew polynomially instead of exponentially. The idea
behind this technique is that some elements produced by tensor-product rules are
more important for representing multidimensional functions than the others.

The tensor-product typically takes as parameters the dimension of the grid and
the number of points, :math:`n` to be evaluated at in each dimension which produces a
grid with :math:`n^d` points. Note that for non-regular grid where the number of points
is different in each dimension, the resulting number of points is eventually
similar.

The Smolyak grid takes an *accuracy* parameter and the number of
dimensions :math:`d` as parameters. The number
of Smolyak grid points is then deterministic:

.. math::

    n(d = 1) = 1 + 2 d, 
    n(d = 2) = 1 + 4d + 4d(d-1),
    ...

Notice that the number of grid points grows linearly with :math:`d = 1`, and
quadratically with :math:`d=2` ...

The standard construction of a Smolyak grid uses nested sets of points.
One typically uses the extrema of the *Chebyshev Polynomials*, which are known as
the *Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto points*. 

Smolyak interpolation consists of two objects: a grid and a interpolating
polynomial. Typically, the sparse grid is generated using nested sets of the
extrema of the Chebychev polynomials. Similarly, the polynomial is constructed
using nested sets of uni-dimensional basis polynomials (generally Chebychev
polynomials of the first kind). There have been numerous applications of this
procedure to economic models.
